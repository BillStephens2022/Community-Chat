  ## Description

Community Chat is a social media app where users can post text, images, and videos as well as live chat with other users online.  You are able to comment on others' posts and when you click on the photos a modal pops up which features the photos in a larger format on a carousel where you can scroll through.   Community Chat is a team collaboration among 4 Rutgers Coding Bootcamp Students.  Several technologies were used to build this project - Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, Cloudinary, Socket.io, Passport.js, and Handlebars.

  ## Usage
  
  Go to the deployed app in Heroku (https://community-chat.herokuapp.com/).  The app features a landing page where you can read about us and decide to sign up or sign in.  Once signed in you will update your profile with some basic information including uploading a profile picture.  Once your profile is updated, you will arrive on your dashboard where you can create new posts. Any new posts created by you will be rendered onto your dashboard.  The home menu item will bring you to the home page where you can view the entire community's posts.  When you click on a post, you will be brought to a page where you can see other's comments and post your own comments.  Click on the pictures of others' posts, and a modal will pop up where you can view the photos in a larger format and scroll through.  If you would like to live chat with other users that are online, click on the Chatroom item in the nav bar.  Enjoy!
